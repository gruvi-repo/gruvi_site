- title:  Action-Driven 3D Indoor Scene Evolution
  image: ma_siga16_action.png
  description: We introduce a framework for action-driven evolution of 3D indoor scenes, where the goal is to simulate how scenes are altered by human actions, and specifically, by object placements necessitated by the actions. To this end, we develop an action model with each type of action combining information about one or more human poses, one or more object categories, and spatial configurations of object-object and object-human relations for the action. Importantly, all these pieces of information are learned from annotated photos.

- title: Model-driven Sketch Reconstruction with Structure-oriented Retrieval
  image: li_siga16tb.png
  description: We propose an interactive system that aims at lifting a 2D sketch into a 3D sketch with the help of existing models in shape collections. The key idea is to exploit part structure for shape retrieval and sketch reconstruction. We adopt sketch-based shape retrieval and develop a novel matching algorithm which considers structure in addition to traditional shape features.

- title: Learning 3D Scene Synthesis from Annotated RGB-D Images
  image: zeinab_sgp16_scene.png
  description: We present a data-driven method for synthesizing 3D indoor scenes by inserting objects progressively into an initial, possibly, empty scene. Instead of relying on few hundreds of hand-crafted 3D scenes, we take advantage of existing large-scale annotated RGB-D datasets, in particular, the SUN RGB-D database consisting of 10,000+ depth images of real scenes, to form the prior knowledge for our synthesis task. Our object insertion scheme follows a co-occurrence model and an arrangement model, both learned from the SUN dataset.

- title: Learning How Objects Function via Co-Analysis of Interactions
  image: hu_sig16_icon2.png
  description: We introduce a co-analysis method which learns a functionality model for an object category, e.g., strollers or backpacks. Like previous works on functionality, we analyze object-to-object interactions and intra-object properties and relations. Differently from previous works, our model goes beyond providing a functionalityoriented descriptor for a single object; it prototypes the functionality of a category of 3D objects by co-analyzing typical interactions involving objects from the category.

  description:We develop a new kind of "space-filling" curves, connected Fermat spirals, and show their compelling properties as a tool path fill pattern for layered fabrication. Unlike classical space-filling curves such as the Peano or Hilbert curves, which constantly wind and bind to preserve locality, connected Fermat spirals are formed mostly by long, low-curvature paths. This geometric property, along with continuity, influences the quality and efficiency of layered fabrication.

  description: We introduce a novel approach to measure similarity between two 3D shapes based on sparse reconstruction of shape descriptors. The main feature of our approach is its applicability to handle incomplete shapes. We characterize the shapes by learning a sparse dictionary from their local descriptors. The similarity between two shapes A and B is defined by the error incurred when reconstructing B's descriptor set using the basis signals from Aâ€™s dictionary.

- title: MeshFlow: Minimum Latency Online Video Stabilization
  image: liu_16_eccv.PNG
  description: Many existing video stabilization methods often stabilize videos off-line, i.e. as a postprocessing tool of pre-recorded videos. Some methods can stabilize videos online, but either require additional hardware sensors (e.g., gyroscope) or adopt a single parametric motion model (e.g., affine, homography) which is problematic to represent spatiallyvariant motions. In this paper, we propose a technique for online video stabilization with only one frame latency using a novel MeshFlow motion model. The MeshFlow is a spatial smooth sparse motion field with motion vectors only at the mesh vertexes.

  description: A perennial problem in recovering 3-D models from images is repeated structures common in modern cities. The problem can be traced to the feature matcher which needs to match less distinctive features (permitting wide-baselines and avoiding broken sequences), while simultaneously avoiding incorrect matching of ambiguous repeated features. To meet this need, we develop RepMatch.

Unlike previous approaches that usually assume either static scenes or cameras, our method is capable of handling both dynamic scenes and moving cameras. Under a bottom-up framework, it first clusters pixels into coherent groups using color and motion features. These pixel groups are then analyzed in a fully connected graph, and labeled as either fence or non-fence using graph-cut optimization. Finally, we solve a dense Conditional Random Filed (CRF) constructed from multiple frames to enhance both spatial accuracy and temporal coherence of the segmentation

For surface completion, we introduce a novel skeleton-driven morph-to-fit, or morfit, scheme which reconstructs the shape as an ensemble of generalized cylinders. Morfit is a hybrid operator which optimally interpolates between adjacent curve profiles (the "morph") and snaps the surface to input points (the "fit") ...

The blending operations are defined on a spatio-structural graph composed of medial curves and sheets. Such a shape abstraction is structure-oriented, part-aware, and facilitates topology manipulations. Fundamental topological operations including split and merge are realized by allowing one-to-many correspondences between the source and the target ..

To organize a heterogenous scene collection, we cluster the scenes based on a set of extracted focal points: scenes in a cluster are closely connected when viewed from the perspective of the representative focal points of that cluster ... The problem of focal point extraction is intermixed with the problem of clustering groups of scenes based on their representative focal points. We present a co-analysis algorithm ...

In contrast to GISIFs obtained from geodesic distances, our spectral GISIFs are robust to local topological changes. Additionally, for symmetry analysis our spectral GISIFs can be viewed as generalizations of the classical Heat (HKSs) and Wave Kernel Signatures (WKSs), and, as such, represent a more expressive and versatile class of functions ...

  description: We introduce a new type of meshes called 5-6-7 meshes, analyze their properties, and present a 5-6-7 remeshing algorithm. A 5-6-7 mesh is a closed triangle mesh where each vertex has valence 5, 6, or 7. We prove that it is always possible to convert an arbitrary mesh into a 5-6-7 mesh. We present a remeshing algorithm which converts a closed triangle mesh with arbitrary genus into a 5-6-7 mesh which a) closely approximates the original mesh geometrically, e.g., in terms of feature preservation, and b) has a comparable vertex count as the original mesh.

While the classical application of MCF is surface fairing, we take advantage of its area-minimizing characteristic to drive the curvature flow towards the extreme so as to collapse the input mesh geometry and obtain a skeletal structure. By analyzing the differential characteristics of the flow, we reveal that MCF locally increases shape anisotropy. This justifies the use of curvature motion for skeleton computation, and leads to the generation of what we call "mean curvature skeletons" ...

  description: A 5-6-7 mesh is a closed triangle mesh where each vertex has valence 5, 6, or 7. An intriguing question is whether it is always possible to convert an arbitrary mesh into a 5-6-7 mesh. In this paper, we answer the question in the positive. We present a 5-6-7 remeshing algorithm which converts any closed triangle mesh with arbitrary genus into a 5-6-7 mesh which a) closely approximates the original mesh geometrically, e.g., in terms of feature preservation, and b) has a comparable vertex count as the original mesh.

- title: Empirical Mode Decomposition on Surfaces
  image: wang_gmp12.png  
  description: Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a powerful tool for the analysis of non-stationary and nonlinear signals, and has drawn a great deal of attention in various areas. In this paper, we generalize the classical EMD from Euclidean space to surfaces represented as triangular meshes. Inspired by the EMD, we also make a first step in using the extremal envelope method for feature-preserving smoothing.

The technique utilizes the point samples not only for local surface position estimation but also to obtain global visibility information under the assumption that each acquired point is visible from a point laying outside the shape. This enables associating each point with a generalized cone, called the visibility cone, that carves a portion of the outside ambient space of the shape from the inside out.

A significant benefit of our approach is its ability to reconstruct multiple overlapping trees simultaneously without segmentation.

We first describe a generalized physically-based reflectance model that relates the distribution of surface normals inside each pixel area to its reflectance function. The distribution of surface normals can be computed from the reflectance functions recorded in photometric stereo images. A convexity measure of subpixel geometry structure is also recovered at each pixel, through an analysis of brightness attenuation due to shadowing. Then, we use the recovered distribution of surface normals and the surface convexity to infer subpixel geometric structures on a surface of homogeneous material by spatially arranging the normals among pixels at a higher resolution than that of the input image

This framework can be applied to several widely used parametric reflectance models and can be implemented in graphics hardware for real-time processing, using a presented hardware-accelerated technique for non-linear filtering of mixture model parameters.

  image: liu_et_al_cgi06.jpg
  description: We apply Nystrom method, a sub-sampling and reconstruction technique, to speed up spectral mesh processing. We first relate this method to Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This enables us to derive a novel measure in the form of a matrix trace, based soly on sampled data, to quantify the quality of Nystrom approximation ...

- title: Robust 3D Shape Correspondence in the Spectral Domain
  image: jain_zhang_smi06.jpg
  description: We present an algorithm for finding a meaningful correspondence between two 3D shapes given as triangle meshes. Our algorithm operates on embeddings of the two shapes in the spectral domain so as to normalize them with respect to uniform scaling, rigid-body transformation and shape bending ...

- title: Minimum Ratio Contours on Surface Meshes
  image: clements_zhang_smi06.jpg
  description: We present a novel approach for discretely optimizing contours on the surface of a triangle mesh. This is achieved through the use of a minimum ratio cycle (MRC) algorithm, where we compute a contour having the minimal ratio between a novel contour energy term and the length of the contour ...

- title: Expression-Invariant Face Recognition with Expression Classification
  image: li_zhang_crv06.jpg
  description: Facial expression, which changes face geometry, usually has an adverse effect on the performance of a face recognition system. On the other hand, face geometry is a useful cue for recognition. Taking these into account, we utilize the idea of separating geometry and texture information in a face image ...

- title: Image-based Plant Modeling 
  image: quan_06_tog.PNG
  description:In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic technique for modeling plants directly from images. Our image-based approach has the distinct advantage that the resulting model inherits the realistic shape and complexity of a real plant. We designed our modeling system to be interactive, automating the process of shape recovery while relying on the user to provide simple hints on segmentation. Segmentation is performed in both image and 3D spaces, allowing the user to easily visualize its effect immediately

- title: Separation of Highlight Reflections from Textured Surfaces
  image: tan_06_cvpr.PNG
  description:We present a method for separating highlight reflections on textured surfaces. In contrast to previous techniques that use diffuse color information from outside the highlight area to constrain the solution, the proposed method further capitalizes on the spatial distributions of colors to resolve ambiguities in separation that often arise in real images. For highlight pixels in which a clear-cut separation cannot be determined from color space analysis, we evaluate possible separation solutions based on their consistency with diffuse texture characteristics outside the highlight

- title: Resolution-Enhanced Photometric Stereo
  image: tan_06_eccv.PNG
  description: In this work, we propose a technique for resolution-enhanced photometric stereo, in which surface geometry is computed at a resolution higher than that of the input images. To achieve this goal, our method first utilizes a generalized reflectance model to recover the distribution of surface normals inside each pixel. This normal distribution is then used to infer sub-pixel structures on a surface of uniform material by spatially arranging the normals among pixels at a higher resolution according to a minimum description length criterion on 3D textons over the surface

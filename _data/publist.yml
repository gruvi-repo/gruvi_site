  description:
    We  propose  an approach to transform a ‘pristine’ material into a better (meta-) superconductor by making use of modern fabrication techniques -- designing and engineering the electronic properties of thin films via periodic patterning on the nanoscale.

- title: Poor electronic screening in lightly doped Mott insulators observed with scanning tunneling microscopy
  image: TIBB.png
  description:
    We develop a simple model to interpret STM results on lightly doped Mott insulators, and find that the effective Mott gap measured by STM correspons to the one measured with other techniques when taking into account the poor electronic screeing.

  description:
    We discover of electronic order, pseudo gap phase separation and an impurity-band Mott transition in an iridate compound, cuprate-style. Along the way, we gained unique knowledge on how a Mott state collapses.

- title: Identifying the fingerprint of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in iron pnictide superconductors
  image: Pub_FP.png
  description:
    Both the density of states and the QPI dispersion of LiFeAs shows signatures of electron-boson coupling. Comparing these with fingerprints of different boson couplings to conclude that these signatures stem from AF spin fluctuations.

  description:
    Using APRES, we find that the bands in Sr3Ru2O7 look more like in heavy fermion material than in a normal metal. We present a detailed investigation into the formation of this particular electronic  structure.

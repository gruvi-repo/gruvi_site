    Gruviers Volunteered for SIG'2018
  text: >-
    Two gruviers were student volunteers (SV) at the SIGGRAPH 2018 conference. While the attendees were certainly thankful for all the work that all the volunteers put in the event, our gruvi volunteers described how valuable the experience was for them! Zhiqin got the chance to use the hardware available at the exhibition hall to print the awesome gruvi logo on the hat shown in the picture. He described the great impact that experiencing the latest developments on VR technology had on him:<br /><br /> "I'm honored to be a student volunteer of such a great conference. VR was definitely a highlight of SIGGRAPH 2018. There were many showcases of applying haptic technology to VR and utilizing VR for designing and creating content. The immersive pavilion was awesome and provided me all kinds of VR experiences. I am looking forward to next SIGGRAPH!"<br /><br />Akshay, on the other hand, emphasized the connections he was able to forge during his time as a volunteer:<br /><br />"This was my first SIGGRAPH and my first time as a SIG-SV. The kind of atmosphere, the exuberance of energy and experience that I felt was surreal and I was left wanting for more when it ended. Memories of a lifetime with awesome fellow SV's, coordinating various programs and above all, the latest technology!! Definitely want to relive this again at SIG'19."

    GrUVi presentations @ SIG'2018
  text: >-
    SIGGRAPH 2018 was held in Vancouver from August 12 to 16, at the Vancouver Convention Centre. The majority of GrUVi members attended the conference, some as paper presenters and some as student volunteers. This year, the lab contributed four papers that were presented in the Technical Papers program (see [link to my pub page]). Ali presented his paper on semi-supervised analysis of 3D shape styles and Kangxue presented his paper on P2P-NET, both on Thursday, in the paper session on Shape Analysis. Also notably, long-term collaborator with GrUVi and adjunct professor with the SFU School of Computing Science, Prof. Daniel Cohen-Or, is featured as the annual SIGGRAPH Achievement Award winner. Danny has been collaborating with Richard Zhang and students in the lab since 2008!

    A special event honouring Professor Eugene Fiume, on the occasion of his 60-th birthday, was held at the SFU Harbour Center on August 17, right after SIGGRAPH 2018. Many of Eugene's first-generation PhDs from the University of Toronto attended the celebratory workshop and gave their account of fun and inspiring stories about what it was like to be his graduate students. Eugene's computer graphics instructor during his undergraduate years at the University of Waterloo provided hint of how Eugene was already "ahead of the class" then. The event featured Prof. Pat Hanrahan from Stanford University, as the keynote speaker. Pat spoke of "theory vs. practice" to highlight how over the years, Eugene has been among the rare group of people in computer graphics, who have emphasized the importance of theory in the field.

  text: Congrats to Jaime for successfully defending his MSC thesis on "Towards Learning of a Joint Geometry-Structure Manifold for Shape Exploration".<br /><br /> Here is the abstract of his thesis.<br /><br /> We present a first attempt at producing a continuous generative model of 3D objects from a joint representation that incorporates the discrete structural variability as well as the continuous geometric variability that are often present in collections of man-made shapes. Starting from a set of compatibly segmented shapes, our main contribution consists in demonstrating the construction of the joint representation. Then, by using Gaussian Process learning to produce a predictive manifold from the joint representation, we investigate its capabilities and limitations for reproducing and synthesizing new shapes.

The researchers&nbsp;would like to assure you that no person, dog, or any other animals were killed as the result of conducting this thesis research.<br /><br /> Here is the abstract of her work:<br /><br /> We introduce a shape modeling tool, ExquiMo, which is guided by the idea of improving the creativity of 3D shape designs through collaboration. Inspired by the game of Exquisite Corpse, our tool allocates distinct parts of a shape to multiple players who model the assigned parts in a sequence. Our approach is motivated by the understanding that effective surprise leads to creative outcomes. Hence, to maintain the surprise factor of the output, we conceal the previously modeled parts from the most recent player. Part designs from individual players are fused together to produce an often unexpected, hence creative, end result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of collaborative modeling for both man-made and natural shapes. Our results show that, when compared to models designed by individual users, multi-user collaborative modeling via ExquiMo tends to lead to more creative designs in terms of the most common criteria used to identify creative artifacts.

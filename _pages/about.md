We are an inter-disciplinary team of researchers exploring and developing novel methods in computer graphics, computer vision, and interactive techniques, based in the <a href="www.cs.sfu.ca">School of Computing Science</a> at <a href="www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University<a/>. Current areas of focus include geometric modelling and processing, image-based modelling, 3D reconstruction, 3D content creation, shape analysis, lighting and reflectance models, and 3D vision for robotics.

The lab was first founded in 1992 by Professor Tom Calvert whose work in human animation led to the now famous LifeForms software and the startup firm Credo Inc. Today, we have a modern infrastructure, supported through two Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grants and two NSERC Research Tools and Instruments grants. Student support is provided by NSERC Discovery Grants, several NSERC Strategic Project Grants, along with funding from GRAND NCE, MITACS, and Precarn. Three GrUVi faculty have won the prestigious NSERC Discovery Accelerator grants.

We collaborate with gaming, VFX, and geo-map industries and leading researchers from across the globe. One of the industrial internships carried out by members of the lab had won an Award of Excellence from MITACS, the funding agency.

While you will find many of our alumni all across the private sector at places such as Apple, Electronic Arts, Google, and Facebook, some of our best graduates are now professors at Carleton University, University of Calgary, University of Florida, and University of Victoria.
